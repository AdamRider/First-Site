    <h2>OBJECTIVE OR PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY</h2>
        <p>
            I am a web developer with a vast array of 
            knowledge in many different front end and 
            back end languages, responsive frameworks, 
            databases, and best code practices. 
            My objective is simply to be the best web 
            developer that I can be and to contribute to 
            the technology industry all that I know and 
            can do. I am dedicated to perfecting my craft 
            by learning from more seasoned developers, 
            remaining humble, and continuously making 
            strides to learn all that I can about 
            development. 
            While a student I studied Mathematics, 
            and I believe that my understanding 
            of problem solving and complex algorithms are 
            also skills that have and will continue to 
            contribute to my overall success as a developer.
